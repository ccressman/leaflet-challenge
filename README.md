Leaflet Visualization Project

URL to site: https://ccressman.github.io/leaflet-challenge/

This project utilizes Javascript(Leaflet) and HTML to create a live dashboard visualizing global earthquake data from the last seven days.

The earthquake data is sourced from the United States Geological Survey (https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson). Leaflet was used to translate this data into an interactive map illustrating the size and depth of seismic activity. Additionally, the site provides the option to add a tectonic plate layer. The data used to create this layer can be found at the following link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fraxen/tectonicplates/master/GeoJSON/PB2002_boundaries.json.
